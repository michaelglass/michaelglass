### 🕸 Mr Website 🏄‍♀️

## I'm Michael!

I've spent the last 8 years building 👩‍🏫NoRedInk.com📝 (and trying to make my colleagues feel cared about. I think they are the best!).

I like 🧮functional programmingλ, but more than that, 🤗I like you👯‍♂️.

🗣If you wanna chat with me, you can find me 
- 👨‍💻 in the [Elm lang slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/),
- 👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 or in Berlin at the Elm meetup / ElmBridge that I host with @w0rm.

## 👨‍🏫 coaching!
If you are new to programming, especially if you're from an under-represented group of people in the software industry, I'm available for free mentorship & coaching.
